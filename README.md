**1. High-Value Brands & Models: Where the Money Is**

* **Popular Makes:** More accessible brands such as *Maruti*, *Hyundai*, *Honda*, and *Tata* show high turnover. Focus your base inventory on these, especially newer models for better margins.

* **2nd Owner:** Avg price ₹547K, Odometer 61K km

**6. Geographic Hotspots for Demand & Pricing**

* **Top Cities by Volume:** Delhi NCR, Bangalore, Chennai, Nashik
* **Highest Avg Price:** Ludhiana (₹742K), Jaipur (₹783K), Chennai (₹758K)

* Value dips from ₹907K (1 yr) to ₹688K (6 yrs) to ₹431K (10 yrs)

**Recommendation:** Source cars aged 2–5 years for the best balance between price, condition, and resale value.

**8. Mileage Matters: Optimal Odometer Bands**

* **Sweet Spots:** 20K–40K km and 40K–60K km (most sales occur here)

**Recommendation:** Prioritize vehicles with odometers under 60K km to match customer preference and ensure vehicle reliability.

---

**Investor Takeaway:**
This business plan, backed by clean data and market analysis, outlines:

* What to buy (Top models, Petrol, Manual, 1st owners)
* Where to sell (Delhi NCR, Chennai, Ludhiana, Nashik)
* When to buy/sell (2–5-year-old cars under 60K km)

With this roadmap, a new dealer can minimize acquisition risk, align with customer expectations, and grow a lean, profitable car dealership.
